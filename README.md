# DC-GAN
Prototype implementation of DC-GAN for Remote Sensing Image Generation. The Prototype is used with MNIST Handwritten dataset.

The code is the prototype of the network actually being used. GAN network has 2 parts 
1) The Discriminator : To distinguish real data from fake data generated by the generator .
2) The Generator : To generate real looking fake samples from latent noise.

Over the time as the network gets trained, generator becomes more and more efficient in generating samples that can fool the discrimnator.
After training of entire network is complete , the accuracy is at 60%, which indicates that discriminator is not able to differentiate
between real samples and fake samples.
